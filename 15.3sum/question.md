## 15. 3Sum
Given an array nums of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in nums such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]
Example 2:

Input: nums = []
Output: []
Example 3:

Input: nums = [0]
Output: []
 

Constraints:

0 <= nums.length <= 3000
-105 <= nums[i] <= 105
